# Overview
Website that calls an API with Fishing Products and renders them using React Hooks. Allows user to add/remove items from a cart and calculate total. Part 1 of 3 part project to make an e-commerce website with a shopping cart, a Shipping Info page and a user authentication login dashboard.

## Description
You've been asked to help design a local bait and tackle company's new online store. They are currently the largest supplier of bluegrass fishing equipment and they are super excited to bring their business to the world wide web in hopes they become a fishing phenomenon!
The store owners want to use the newest technologies available but they only want to pay for one sprint. Your job will require you to use React Hooks so that way their online store can stay current for a long time and require less maintenance since the code footprint will be much smaller, thus, fewer lines of code to write, if done correctly. One more thing: they would like to keep track of their customers so they can add them to an email list, so they will need a strong user authentication (no anonymous transactions).
For this project, we will be using React Hooks to create a responsive and reactive order form with smart navigation and user auth.
The basic requirement is to familiarize yourself with hooks, which requires you to go down one of the three paths for this project: User Auth, Shopping Cart, or Shipping Info. Once you complete one of these three paths you are complete, but feel free to achieve the other 2 paths, as well as the trifecta (requires all three paths to be complete): Purchasing a Cart.

## Currently Complete
#### Path 1 (Shopping Cart) 
A user can see all the products listed on the products page.
A user can see a product page when they click on a product (from the products page or from their cart).
When the user clicks "add to cart" on a product(s), add it to the cart.
A user can modify the number of total cart items in their cart by adding to the cart from the product page or removing an item from the cart.
A user can update the number of unique items in their cart (purchase 2 rods vs 1 rod, vs 0 rods [remove from cart if 0]
A user can remove an item from cart using a remove button.
A user can clear their cart.
The cart persists in localstorage.
